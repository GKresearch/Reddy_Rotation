Primers

"Primer Sheet - Gkennedy - 2023-01-23.xlsx" includes the first four primers I designed, labelled PGK1-PGK4. They were designed as part of a project to make the A832 mutation in LB/Hyper LB. This did not succeed, but I did use some of Schuyler's primers to make the A908D mutation in both dAsCas12 and dAsCas12 Ultra. This is on Schuyler's primer sheet, PSM749-PSM753.

2023-02-07_gRNAs_Crafted_Split_With_Genomic_Primers_For_Experiment.csv has the name and PGK# (what the primers tubes are labelled) for all primers I used. The R# is what I defined as the reaction and I used it for giving a code for all my own tests.  

2023-01-31_gRNAs_Crafted_Split_With_Genomic_Primers.csv lists the primers as well with a bit more information.
