Primers

2023-02-07_gRNAs_Crafted_Split_With_Genomic_Primers_For_Experiment.csv has the name and PGK# (what the primers tubes are labelled) for all primers I used. The R# is what I defined as the reaction and I used it for giving a code for all my own tests.  

2023-01-31_gRNAs_Crafted_Split_With_Genomic_Primers.csv lists the primers as well with a bit more information.
